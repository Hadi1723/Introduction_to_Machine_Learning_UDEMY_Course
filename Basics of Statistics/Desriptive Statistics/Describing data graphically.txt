Frequency Distribution for QUALITATIVE DATA:
	- Definition: a list of allcategories and the number of elements that belong top each of the category
		- This is like the frequency table that we formed in R
	- Formula for relative frequency of category = (relative frequency of category) / (Sum of all frequencies)

Bar graph for QUALITATIVE DATA: 
	- Definition: a graph made of bars whose heights represent the ferquencies of respective categories
	- The bar graph equilvalent of a frequency distribution table
	- x-axis is the categories
	- y-axis is the frequencies
	- NOTE: this is the same bargraph that we formed in R

Frequency Distribution for QUANTATIVE DATA:
	- Definition: lists all the CLASSES (ranges independent variables) and the number that belong to each catagory
	- Steps on how to form these types of data:
		1. Select number of classes/ranges 
			- Typically between 5 and 20
		2. Calculate the class width (the size of range)
			- Class width = (max value - min value) / number of classes
			- Round answer as needed
		3. Complete the table

Histogram for for QUANTATIVE DATA:
	- Definition: It is a graph consisting of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other
	- Horizontal axis represent the ranges
	- Vertical axis represent the frequencies
	- NOTE: this is the same histogram that we formed in R
	- Types of Histogram:
		1. Symmetric
		2. Skewed (asymmetric)
		3. Uniform (all bars form a smooth, perfect rectangle)

Normal Distribution:
	- for continuous (meaning for quantatitive data) data that is SYMETRIC and bell-shaped
	- The graph that depicts normal distribution describes that the dependent variable (probability density) is a function of the distance between the current data value and the mean
		- The peak value is the mean
			- the curve is symmetric about the mean
		- As we move far away from the mean, the probability of that event happening decreases
		- The probability of a range of value/outcome is calculated by finding the area under the curve
			- The area of the whole curve is 1.0 because all probability of all outcomes must add to 1.0
