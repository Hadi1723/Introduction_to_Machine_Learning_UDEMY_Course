Definition: measurement of dispersion helps one to learn about the SPREAD of a data

Types of measurement of dispersion:
	1. Range
		- Formula: max - min
		- Note: may not be useful because it is also heavily influenced by outliers
	2. Standard Deviation
		- Formula: sqrt(Variance)
		- 2 types:
			a) Population Standard Deviation
				. uses population mean
			b) Sample Standard Deviation
				. uses sample mean
		- Note: a larger standrad deviation indicates MORE SPEAD OUT values
			- the values are farther away from the mean
	
	3. Variance
		- Formula: Standard deviation ^ 2
		- Definition: the mean of the squared differenced from the mean
