Definition: measure of center is a value at the middle of a data set

Types of Measures of Centers:
	1. Mean
		- Definition: just the average of all values
			- Note: heavily influenced by outliers
			- Note: can only be used for quantitative data
		- Two types:
			. Population mean: all data values included
			. Sample mean: only portion of data values included
	2. Median
		- Definition: the value of middle term when ordered in incraesing/decreasing order
			- Note: Median might be a preferred center over mean when talking about skewed data because median is not heavily influencedb by outliers
			- Note: if there are even number of data values, we find average of the two middle terms
			- Note: can only be used for quantitative data
	3. Mode
		- Definition: the most occuring (highest frequency or probability) data value
			- Note: Mode can be used for both quantitative and qualitative data
		- 4 types:
			a) Single mode: only one most-frequent value
			b) Bimodal: two most-frequent values
			c) Multimodel: more than 2 most-frequent values
			d) no mode: no most-frequent values
	4. Mid-Range:
		- Formula: (max + min) / 2

Comparison of centers of types of histrograms:
	1. Symmetric:
		. Mode = Median = Mean
	2. Skewed to the left:
		. Mode < Median < Mean
		. Median is preferred
	3. Skewed to the right:
		. Mean < Median < Mode
		. Median is preferred
	4. Uniform:??
