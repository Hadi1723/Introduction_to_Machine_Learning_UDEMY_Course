. More preferred when a dependent variable has more than 2 classes (when the dependent variable is categorial and there are 2 or more possible values)
. This is based on Bayes Theorem
	. this means that conditional probability is also involved
	. Below is how it is applied:
		. the base classifier (the algorithm) will assign that input-value a SINGLE catagorial outcome based on which ever outcome gave HIGHEST conditional probability of occuring for a SPECIFIC variable
		. See picture for more detail

continuous data are normally distributed
	. has lowest possible theoretical error rate as a result
