We form confusion matriced after our model has been trained and our model is preidtcing classes/values for dependent variable (Which is categorial)

2 types of error involved:
	a) Type 1:
		. when model predicted "Yes" value, but actual default value is "No"
		. False positive
	b) Type 2:
		. when model predicted deafult to be "No", but actual default value is "True"
		. False negative

These two types of error leads to costs and ineffiencies


One way to identify the best classifier is through the ROC curve
	 the curve whose area is closest to 1.0 will be identifies as the best classifier

Other ways to judge performance of logistic regression modles include precision score and recall score
