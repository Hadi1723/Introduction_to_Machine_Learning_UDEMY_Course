KNN is a non-parametric method
	. we don't assume any function form of model
		. this leads to potentially high accuracy
		. no functional form because curves cannot be modeled

K-value (hyper parameter) because it controls the flexibility of the KNN classifier
	. the higher the K-value, the less flexible the bounfdaries of the classufier
		. so we must choose our k-value accordingly as flexibility controls high/low testing error
	. we need to standardize data to avoid scaling problems
		. high quantity should have impact based on context (something that doesn't occur because of scaling problems)
		. standarizing independent values implies that the mean of each independent variable becomes 0 and the standrad deviation of each independent variable becomes 1
